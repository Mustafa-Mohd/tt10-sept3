    title: 'Feminism',

    quote:
      '"Feminism is not a battle of genders but a call to understand and respect our unique strengths."',
    content: `What feminism is all about? Where it comes? Why is the folks roar for this kind of rights? When we gaze around everybody is feeling anxious about something and anything or nothing at all? Why? What is this feminism virus is all about?

"Feminism is not a battle of genders but a call to understand and respect our unique strengths. True empowerment lies not in rivalry, but in overcoming the barriers created by outdated customs and perspectives."

People said that the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. But which sex/gender they are fighting? What equality do they want? Are they dejected individuals in the humankind? If they want equality based on political and educational we can realize but who they are battle and want equal opportunity?

First, we should learn who discover this word and what is the main thought? Even, if you Google for feminism you can find the different types of feminism which is a practical joke by themselves. Let's get back to history, Charles Fourier, a utopian socialist and French philosopher, is credit with having coined the word "feminisme" in 1837. The words "feminisme" (feminism) and "feminiest" (feminist) first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872, Great Britain in the 1890s and the United States in 1910.

Feminist movements have campaigned and continued to campaigns for women's rights, including the right to vote, hold public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. So, it is obvious that feminism has pros and cons but if we look closely this word is nothing but foul-play.

First, why we have to fight for these rights with our opposite masculinity? We are the precious creature bought by Almighty equally with different features, qualities, and powers, and that beautiful creatures are man and woman. They are made for each other and they don't have to fight with each other. Yes, but our traditions, customs and rituals built these barriers which suppress us to fight for our rights and that doesn't mean our religion teach us. They are people who make these conspiracy theories and want us to think and speak negatively.

This word is invented by some so-called woman and how one particular woman knows what women right should be & what woman actually want? If we look at all these clauses these rights are already given to us by Islam and other respected religions. These peoples are unhappy soul and so much bitter. Their lives are hell by their actions. They just want to hide their failure and play the victim card.

Why we have to be equal to man when in reality we are not? We both have a different physique and strength but that doesn't mean woman are weak, and they have to depend on them, & don't have to live their lives. They have every right to breathe and prove this society. They should be opportunist because they are so capably of. When a woman gives birth to a child she has so much strength in it even strength can't define by itself. Our Islam also gives us the property right. Women are not made to be in veils they can even participate in political and social events like Hazrat-E-Ayesha (R.A) did, whenever our Prophet S.A.W (PUBH) had to take any political decision. He (S.A.W) always discusses it with her wife even though she was so younger than Him.

There were so many women in Islam who ruled so many Kingdoms and even contributed towards philosophy which is still preserved somewhere in Museums. They don't need any introduction and for the fact, our Prophet Mohammad S.A.W (PUBH) had a bodyguard during that era, who protect them from any injuries and they were also a woman that's what the status of woman in our religion? But still, there are people over across the world that is fighting without reason and don't know the actual truth. They have no basic knowledge that they have to fight with their traditions, thoughts and laws which is also made by ordinary people like me & you.

This feminist word is like a disease that is spreading more and more, and even dangerous than COVID-19. From my point of view, this feminist word tells us that man has no right to live on this planet. This should be only the woman in the world but they forget that this world is made of every creature and we are among them. #MeToo movement was also an example of this wave. Why #MeToo could happen only with the woman? It could happen with anyone, even man and third gender (known as Transgender). I know some people will not agree with my statement but this is the truth. These peoples are just racist and bitter one towards the happy one. You can say that these woman folk experiences something bitter and harsh so they feel that every woman is in suffer and pain. This is my opinion and rest is up to you, think about it.`,

    title: 'Body Shaming',
    img: '/assets/4001198.jpg',
    quote:
      '"True beauty lies in embracing who you are, not in meeting the expectations of others."',
    content: `We all have our insecurities regarding overweight, our socio-economic status, our physical appearance, or our job. We all experience the emotions associated with the feeling of being insecure.

"True beauty lies in embracing who you are, not in meeting the expectations of others. Let go of the weight of judgment and find strength in self-love and confidence."

What can only make our insecurities worse is when other people take advantage of them. When an individual highlights our weakness through the joke or normal, it can become a person's greatest fear as It can bring out your emotions lead you on the path of Embarrassments, Anxiety, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Low self-esteem, Low self-worth, Low self-Image, etc. Say for example, on a group of friends you are the one who is overweight and they use to call you "Fatty, Penguin, Panda etc". For them it is normal and you also know that it is normal in a group. They adore and admire you still it will enlist as body shaming and it affects you mentally and physically. You go on and follow the specific diet list so that you can get rid of these particular nicknames.

But what is this body shaming? The person who is given these nicknames is aware or not, but they are the reason for your mental suffering. "Capitalizing on an individual's insecurities or it is the act or practice of humiliating a person based on their Body Type, Size, Shape, Style, Clothing Choices, Hair Style, and Makeup, etc". It refers to a person's physical appearance but it can negatively affect both mental and physical aspects of a person's life.

Due to the strong presence of social media in our everyday's life, we are addicted daily to images of perceived perfectionism; public image is noted upon through public comments and likes which gave you feedback, both negative and positive. This term is called Pop Culture. This tends them to diet, exercise, and fashion trend to pave the way for how a person looks and they considered them to be 'cool'

Body shaming manifests in many ways: 1) Criticizing your appearances, through a judgment or comparison to another person. 2) Criticizing another's appearance in front of them. 3) Criticizing another's appearance without their knowledge.

This body-shaming impacts mental health issues like I said before, some of the issues include; 1. Social anxiety: When you are publicly bullied or the natural response. This can culminate into isolating itself and avoiding social interaction. 2. Depression: When you feel lonely and sorry for one develop into a state of depression. It increases feelings of self-image, self-worth etc. 3. Eating disorder: It is a really funny term for you but it is, in reality, the onset of unhealthy eating habits due to feelings of loss of control and low self-esteem. The act of binging and purging is called Bulimia while the act of refuse to eat anything is called Anorexia.

The serious mental and physical impact that body shaming can have on an individual, young or old, is reason enough to understand why bullying someone else's appearance is not appropriate or kind. It s not funny, no more jokes, please! The fantastic thing about humanity is that we're all different individuals. We come in all shapes and sizes, and no two of us are the same. Having lived a life where people constantly asking me that why I am so chubby? Why I am overweight? "Please put off your weight" etc. First, I am comfortable with the way I look. I have a self positivity not everyone has. We are not answerable to anyone; the way we look is quite frankly nobody else's business. The people are talking on your back or face, doesn't matter. It is just fuel to the fire.

Body shaming seems to be high, with the advent of social media and the ability to pass comments on people you hardly know. People are stress over such a wrong message. Women have such a hard time feeling. Different is beautiful. Not perfect is beautiful. Happy is beautiful. Confidence is beautiful. Don't let others bring you down or tell you who you are? Like you ever before.

Nothing else matters. What you see is what you get. Look in the mirror and be happy with what you see. Your opinion of yourself is the only option that counts. Everything else doesn't matter. Someone is around you if they are insecure about looks and comments. Please give them your emotional support.`,

    title: 'Marriages',
    img: '/assets/marry.jpg',
    quote:
      '"True marriage is a bond between families, not a display of wealth and status."',
    content: `It is not a relation or bond between two peoples but two families. They have also come into the contract and long term relationship. But, the ongoing COVID-19 has severely affected all spheres of life in Kashmir, and marriages are no exception. What is usually celebrated with a lavish function is now conducted as an unadorned occasion. The peak wedding season in Kashmir starts from late April to October.

"True marriage is a bond between families, not a display of wealth and status. Let us return to simplicity, as taught by our faith, and focus on what truly matters—love, respect, and mutual understanding."

Millions of families in Kashmir had planned their wedding ceremony but the COVID-19 lockdown has reduced marriage gatherings complicated to a simple and trouble-free affair. As per guidelines issued by the J&K authorities, only 25 guests are allowed to attend any marriage ceremony in Kashmir.

What the simple Kashmir marriage look like? The decorations all over the walls, women are singing and dancing, the bulky outfits around 20 kg across bride's body, lots of gold which they have to put on sale or relinquish them to in-laws to protect them for a lifetime because the girls are not going to wear them in future, unnecessarily exchanging of quintals of mutton, chickens, and dry fruits, 07 days of a busy schedule, don't know why?

On average, 400-500 guests are usually invited to a middle-class Kashmiri wedding for almost three days. It is not a marriage; it is just know-it-all to the people that we can manage more acquisitive things rather than anybody else in the room.

What about the poor people? By looking at these pointless things, their eyes also lit up or compellingly come to a decision that now my children's marriage is going to be more grand and lavish than this ceremony. Now, it is not the question of capability but the question of your status and reputation. If they didn't do so, nobody is going to marry their children's. Because, we are living in this society and show-off are must and our birthright

During this COVID-19 marriage ceremony is getting simple which our Islam taught us. Peoples are also out of money that's why they are doing so? They want the ceremony on the budget which is a good sign. But, again the question is; are they going to take this legacy forward and also teach their future generations to do so? Or this is a never-ending process

By reading the daily articles on newspapers, the people of Kashmir are not concern about the simplicity but they are worried about whom to invite or, whom to leave is a tough task? They have a large family but choosing only specific people is a huge issue for them. They are also worried that they planned to cook over 800 kg of meat and chicken for the wedding feast was reduced to 50 kg as the wedding was reduced to a few guests. This is an embarrassing situation for them. The situation has forced the people to do so as everybody is concerned about their safety.

But what comes up with this entire thing. Are we following what our Islamic law (Sharia) taught us? When we look closely into our social norms and conditions, their rituals, custom, and traditions; are they are fulfilling these terms? Or they are just doing their business, and load up their accounts. Are they giving women their rights? Are they practising a simple marriage that our religion taught us? Is man's family pressurizing the woman's families or demanding a dowry to them? By doing these activities they are encouraging humiliation, harassments, and abusing relation.`,
